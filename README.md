# ECE437-Computer-Design-and-Prototying
Computer design is the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components
to build a computer that meets functional, performance and cost goals. In this course, students
will learn how to completely design a correct single processor computer, including processor
datapath, processor control, memory systems, and I/O. We will also learn how to design a
functioning multicore computer. We will learn that no magic is required to make a computer
work. ECE437 serves students two ways. First, for those who will continue in computer
architecture, it lays the foundation of detailed implementation experience necessary to make
meaningful the quantitative tradeoffs found in ECE 565 and ECE666. Second, for those students
not continuing in computer architecture, it unifies concepts introduced in ECE270 and ECE362
and solidifies an intuition about why hardware is as it is. 

Under branches, you'll see singlecycle, pipeline, caches, and multicore branches.
Those are the code for corresponding labs.

For diagrams, midterm report and final report, it is store in the main branch.
